# Insurance-Prediction-with-deployment
In  this machine learning project , We are going tp predict the Insurance cost using some inputs like age , bmi, etc.

We are using the Dataset which is available in Kaggle .( https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance )
The dataset consist of Age , BMI , No of childrens, Gender , Smoker status , region and the insurance charge.
But for this project ,we  are going to negelect the regoin column as this dataset is particularly for the 
certain area but we are building the generalized model for the people across the golbe.

## This project consist of the following steps :
### 1. Creating the Model using python in Google-Colaboratory 
For this project , we are using the Google colabotary ( Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.)
Google Colab provides us the automated setup with pre installed all the basic libraries along with 
the web hosted Memory and Disk-Space.
####       a.Importing the Libraries
All the various important libraries are imported like pandas , numpy , etc. 
And also some of the packages from the sklearn library . 
####       b. EDA and Data preprocessing 
#### c. Building the regression model using various algorithms like SVM , Random Forest and regression
